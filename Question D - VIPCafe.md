# VIPCafe Problem

## Problem Description

Raj runs a busy cafe, frequently visited by VIPs who purchase high-profit beverages. To balance customer satisfaction between VIPs and regular customers, Raj implements a **dynamic priority queue**. The idea is to give precedence to higher-priority orders, primarily those from VIPs, but also adjust the priority of other pending orders to ensure regular customers aren't left waiting too long.

Orders are enqueued with a priority value, and the highest-priority orders are served first. When an order is served, the priority of the preceding orders in the queue increases by 1. This dynamic adjustment ensures a balance between quick service for VIPs and timely service for other customers.

Given the queue of orders and the position of Raj's friend in the queue, determine after how many orders Raj's friend's order will be served.

## Constraints

- \(2 \leq N \leq 25\) (number of orders)
- \(1 \leq \text{Priority} \leq 100\)
- \(1 \leq K \leq N\) (K is the position of Raj's friend's order in the queue)

## Input

- First line: Integer `N` denoting the total number of orders in the cafe queue.
- Second line: `N` space-separated integers representing the priority of the orders in the queue.
- Third line: Integer `K` indicating the position of Raj's friend's order in the queue (1-based index).

## Output

- A single integer representing after how many orders Raj's friend's order will be served.

## Time Limit

1 second

## Example 1

### Input

```
6
1 3 5 2 4 6
4
```

### Output

```
6
```

### Explanation

The queue has 6 orders with the following priorities: `1 3 5 2 4 6`. Raj's friend's order is at the 4th position with priority `2`. The order of serving and priority updates happen as follows:

1. Serve order with priority 6 (6th in the queue). Increment the priorities of the preceding orders: `2 4 5 3 5 x`.
2. Serve order with priority 5 (3rd in the queue): `3 5 x 4 5 x`.
3. Serve order with priority 5 (2nd in the queue): `4 x x 4 5 x`.
4. Serve order with priority 4 (4th in the queue): `5 x x 4 x x`.

Raj's friend's order (position 4) is served after 6 orders.

## Example 2

### Input

```
5
1 4 3 2 5
3
```

### Output

```
3
```

### Explanation

There are 5 orders with the following priorities: `1 4 3 2 5`. Raj's friend's order is at position 3 with priority `3`.

1. Serve order with priority 5 (5th in the queue). Increment the priorities of the preceding orders: `2 5 4 3 x`.
2. Serve order with priority 4 (2nd in the queue): `3 x 4 3 x`.
3. Serve Raj's friend's order (3rd in the queue) on the 3rd turn.

## Python Code Solution

```python
from collections import deque

def when_friend_served(priorities, friend_position):
    queue = deque(enumerate(priorities))  # (index, priority) pairs
    served_count = 0
    
    while queue:
        current_order = queue.popleft()
        if all(current_order[1] >= other[1] for other in queue):
            served_count += 1
            if current_order[0] == friend_position:
                return served_count
        else:
            queue.append(current_order)  # Put the order back at the end if it's not the highest priority

# Input
N = int(input())
priorities = list(map(int, input().split()))
K = int(input()) - 1  # Convert to 0-based index

# Output
print(when_friend_served(priorities, K))
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Parsing**: We read the input values, including the number of orders, their respective priorities, and the friend's position.
2. **Queue Representation**: We use Python's `deque` to simulate the dynamic priority queue, where orders are processed in the correct order.
3. **Main Logic**: The function iterates over the queue. If the current order has the highest priority in the queue, it's served. Otherwise, it goes back to the end of the queue. The function counts how many orders are served until Raj's friend's order is served.

### Complexity

Given the constraints of the problem \(N \leq 25\), this approach is efficient enough within the given time limit of 1 second.

### Example Run

For input:
```
6
1 3 5 2 4 6
4
```

The output will be:
```
6
```

```
